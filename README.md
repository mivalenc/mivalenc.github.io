## About Me

Hello! I'm a recent graduate in Data Science with a passion for turning complex 
data into actionable insights. I thrive on solving real-world problems through
data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. My journey in data
science has equipped me with skills in Python, R, SQL, and with experience in data
visualization tools like Tableau and Matplotlib. 

In this portfolio, you'll find a collection of my projects that showcase my ability
to extract meaningful information from data. I'm particularly intrested in predictive
analytics and natural language processing. I'm excited to continue learning and growing 
in this dynamic field of data science.
